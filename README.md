Just my minimal JavaScript setup for AoC using pure node

To run each problem code just use:  
`pnpm start <day>.js`
- If you run `pnpm start 1.js` it will start server to watch changes for day 1 and part 1 for the current year based on `Date`.  
- If you add `-2.js` suffix in file name, `pnpm start 1-2.js` it will do for day 1 part 2.
